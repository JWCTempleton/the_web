# Learning Outcomes

### Describe what the internet is

The internet is the infrastructure upon which the service of the Web is built. There are other services built on top of the internet such as email and IRC.

### Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data.

When you request a piece of data from a website (a video for ex.) It isn't sent in a big chunk, it is broken up into many smaller chunks called packets that are sent through multiple routers in the most efficient path to your device. Once there they are reassembled in order to be viewed by you.

### Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.

Web pages are made up of the files hosted on web servers. Web browsers are used by the client to access a copy of the files hosted on the web server. Search engines are websites that help users find web pages on other websites. 

### Briefly explain what a client is.

A device of the typical web user (computer connected to wifi, phone, etc.) as well as the web accessing software on that device (browsers).

### Briefly explain what a server is.

A host connected **directly** to the internet that stores files for websites. When a client wants access to a webpage a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server to the client to be displayed on the browser.

### Explain what IP addresses are.

Internet Protocol address, every server has a unique one. IP addresses help computers find each other. Everything connected to the internet either directly or indirectly has an IP address. 

#### Explain what DNS servers are.

Servers that contain domain names and their corresponding IP address. When you look up a website from your browser the domain name goes to the DNS which returns an IP address. Your browser forwards the ip address towards the data center's server.

### What is a network?

### What is the internet?

The hardware that allows many networks to talk to each other.

### What is an IP address?

Internet Protocol address, every server has a unique one. IP addresses help computers find each other. Everything connected to the internet either directly or indirectly has an IP address. 

### What is a router?

### What is a web browser?

A program that allows you to view web pages.

### What is a search engine?

A web service that helps you find other web pages. 

### What is a DNS request?

When you type a website into a browser the browser makes a request to the DNS server where it finds the address of the server the website is hosted on. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for a copy of the website to the client using TCP/IP. If the server approves the message it sends a 200 response and begins sending the files in packets. Your browser reassembled the packets and displays it.
